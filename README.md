isb-ruby
========

isb-ruby is a web-based isb viewer written in Ruby on Rails.

This program will be able do these things:

* check server status
* log-in / log-out
* read & write articles
* write comments
* notifications for new posts on boards you subscribed
* display all of the above in mobile-friendly design

However, this program will not be able to do these things:

* search boards by user name
* read articles without leaving traces
